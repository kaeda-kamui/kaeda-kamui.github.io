    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
    <h3>
      <p>
        First off, the inner-most box contains the content, which can be text or
        imagery, or other content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Padding is the layer beyond the content box, it increases the box's size
        and can be used in conjunction with buttons to increase the size, best
        used to space an element from itself because it is inside the border.
      </p>
      <p>
        The border comes after the padding, it it used for stylish reasons and
        to bring the attention of the content inside to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Margin is the outer-most layer, which is used to space elements away
        from each other. Adjacent elements with different margins values will
        use the higher value. A negative margin value can be used to change the
        position, but it can also make it intersect with another element.
