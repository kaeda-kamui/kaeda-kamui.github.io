    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>Blocked on a simple problem</li>
      <p><span class="bold">Problem: </span>I needed to not have a dot</p>
      <p>
        Error: <span class="code-block-string">gradebook.[studentName]</span>
        <br />Solution:
        <span class="code-block-string">gradebook[studentName]</span>
        <br />Note: The error has a dot before the square brackets whereas the
        solution doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Problem solving technique: </span>
        Used google didn't work, looked at some Python code, but didn't work.
        Eventually just removed the dot because I wondered if it would just work
        because of the square brackets there, and that worked. Took a lot of
        hours but I got there.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Feelings: </span>Frustrated after struggling
        repeatedly, but would take a break or go onto the next task, so I could
        come back refreshed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Lesson: </span>When those square backets are used
        don't use a dot
      </p>
      <li>Elegantly solved a problem</li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Problem: </span>Making a function to get the average
        of a student's test scores, that would take any student and their test
        scores, then return the average.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Problem solving technique: </span>Had already made a
        function to average some numbers, and another function that would grab
        the student's name and their scores. Combined them together for
        solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Feelings: </span>Nothing, it was over quite fast, and
        was really easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Lesson: </span>Nothing. Or maybe make functions to
        streamline future processes.
      </p>
      <li>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes
      </li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Pseudocode: </span> 5/10 I'm used to writing it for
        really large tasks, that require every item to be on scene and in the
        correct place. But using it for small sections of code is unfamiliar to
        me. I'm trying to remember to use pseudocode for larger and more
        difficult blocks of code, on smaller/easy code it isn't needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Rubber ducky method: </span>1/10 I'm not very
        talkative and do not like to hear myself speak, I can do it if its
        necessary, but probably not. I could improve on this if I could get used
        to speaking or hearing my own voice, but it is unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Reading error messages: </span>7/10 Generally I think
        I'm good at understanding error messages, but in this sprint (Sprint 4)
        they were confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Console.logging: </span>9/10 I'm pretty confident in
        my ability to console.log, using it frequently to see what is happening
        during the journey of my code blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Googling: </span>7/10 Unsure if I am not googling
        things properly or if there aren't any available resources for what I'm
        looking for. Outside of this course, I think I can google ok. Used to
        think I was pretty good because I understood matrices, but it may be
        different now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Asking your peers for help: </span>0/10 I shan't
        bother them, they have their own work to do and their own free time to
        spend. I am not to drag them down or impede their study. And I'm sure
        they already have a lot on their plate (metaphorically).
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Asking coaches for help: </span>1/10 Why would I ask
        them for help? I'm sure they have other students to help. I am not to
        bother them.I am not to be a burden. I am more likely to give up than to
        ask for help. If it is something small that I don't understand I might
        ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Improving your process with reflections: </span>8/10
        I'm used to doing this at the end of my tasks. I usually document what I
        did, what worked, why and why not. Even when I do not progress, it does
        help me understand what could be done next time.
      </p>
      <li>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </li>
      <p>
        Most recently on <span>sprint-4/javascript-kata/deBee.js</span> I'd been
        stuck on the last task for a while and it was Friday but I refused to
        ask for help. If I hadn't completed the assignment by the deadline, I
        would've been okay with that outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't ask for help because it is ingrained in my mind not to. I am
        not to speak unless spoken to or given permission. If I were to ask for
        help, it would push my problems onto others, their life is hard enough
        already why should I make it harder for them? It shows weakness, which
        can be and will be used as a weapon against me, it may be okay for
        others to ask but not me. Also I don't like human interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next time I'd do the same thing, but if i was working on a team I would
        ask for help as not to let my team down.
