      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
      <p>
        I want to go home. And also I want to leave this country and build
        houses, mostly concrete ones, with rebar and bricks.
      </p>

      <li>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </li>
      <p>
        Strengths:Taking lots of notes to understand and remind myself how
        things work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limitations: Note-taking takes up a lot of time, and I trouble
        remembering things meaning, I need to refer to my notes more frequently.
      </p>

      <li>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </li>
      <p>I don't know. Act more human?</p>

      <li>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
      </li>
      <p>
        I work in 90 min blocks, and take a short break to reset my focus. When
        things start to build up, I will pick up the pace or ask for help to
        speed things along. And I will always try to complete my assignment by
        the alloted time.
      </p>

      <li>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </li>
      <p>
        Refer to my notes, or look online. If I'm still stuck I will the
        students and/or facilitators.
      </p>

      <li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
      <p>To be able to help and support other students.</p>

      <li>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things

        Everyday at 10am Sofia wakes up, and at 10pm she goes to sleep. I need
        to be there at those specific times so she is not upset. And every few
        months she require me to perform a ritual, which will be on April 1st.
        And after that will be August, or even in July or October.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some weeks once a week I will leave the garage for a few hours for
        personal documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In winter sometimes I need to perform pest control in the garage, adding
        in new poison and detterents, looking for dead mice, slugs and bugs. I
        hate accidentally stepping on them and soiling my feet with slime or
        blood. Or even letting them rot and they get hard to clean up and smell
        awful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I may not be in this country in July, I don't know what is happening
        yet.
