    <h1>JavaScript DOM</h1>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>
        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
      </li>
      <p>
        HTML is the structure and furniture in the house, CSS is the layout of
        the furniture and the color/paint, JavaScript is the running water and
        electrical components.
      </p>
      <li>
        Explain <span>control flow</span> and <span>loops</span> using an
        example process from everyday life.
      </li>
      <p>
        Control flow is the way that JavaScript reads and executes the code. It
        starts from top to bottom, unless there are functions that are called
        first or there is code that doesn't perform until conditions are met.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loops are a block of code that loop until the conditions are fulfilled.
        <br />
        An example of loops: for each foot, put sock on foot, for each foot with
        sock, put shoe on foot with sock
      </p>
      <li>
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </li>
      <p>
        The DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is like a tree of
        information/data. You might interact with it by changing data and that
        will affect what is shown on screen, or how things function.
      </p>
      <li>
        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </li>
      <p>
        To access data from an array, enter the array name followed by square
        brackets [], in between the square brackets enter the index of the
        element you are trying to access. Arrays start counting at 0, so the
        first item in the array would be 0 and not 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        To access data from an object, enter the object name followed by a dot
        then the property name. <br />
        <br />
        Example: ant.color <br />
        <br />
        Here 'ant' is the object name, and '.color' is accessing the color
        property.
      </p>
      <li>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</li>
      <p>
        Functions are a set of code that are nested inside of a function
        statement, when called the function will execute that code. Functions
        are helpful because they can be reused, and the information is declared
        in the function statement. When you want to use a reuse a block of code,
        put it in a function so it can be called whenever you want it.
