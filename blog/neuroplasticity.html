      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <li>What it is and why it is relevant.</li>
      <p>
        Growth Mindset is a mindset of growth. It is a mindset where failures
        can be learning opportunities, and critizism is feedback. Actively
        trying to improve, having good routine. Instead of getting better by
        mindlessly doing it naturally or daily, actually try and learn and
        further your ability. Also accepting you don't know everything, that
        there is room to learn and improve.
