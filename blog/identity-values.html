        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

        When I was 13? I was in an airport in the USA, just deboarded from a
        domestic flight. At some point people were running back towards the
        plane from around a corner, they were screaming and the look on their
        faces is still the most harrowing thing I've seen to this day. As
        everyone ran back, I kept walking forward, unafraid. Many thoughts
        crossed my mind. What are they running from? What is around the corner?
        I didn't mind dying, I smiled and whispered to myself "If I die, I die."
        However another thought came into my mind, If I die.. someone is going
        to see a dead body. I'd seen many dead and mutilated bodies and it is
        not a fun sight. So I ran with the people into a room while a panicked
        worker locked the door, and we all huddled in the back of the room.

          >Maybe it was a good decision for me to run with the crowd, I feel
          like I would've stood out too much if I didn't. But also now, I do
          want to know what everyone was running from.</span

        One I remember from when I was 6, a kid asked the teacher for an eraser
        and he got one, but when I asked, she yelled at me stating that no, I
        could not have an eraser. The whole class laughed, I didn't feel
        ashamed, I just wondered why the other kid could get one but not me. And
        throughout my life this has happened to me, where I do the same thing as
        someone else, but for some reason I am always wrong. She would also let
        the whole class know when I scored a 0 on the daily quick maths, yet not
        actively trying to teach me. Whenever I would ask for help I would not
        get it,
        <span
          >now I rarely ask for help and most times I can get by without having
          to ask someone.</span

        In my middle school when I was 10, there was girl who would often sit
        next to me during lunch time, some days she would share food with me. I
        hated her at first, she was always nice but it made me feel
        uncomfortable because it was unfamiliar to me. One day she gave me half
        of her chocolate bar before class started, but during the lunch break I
        was attacked by a few twelvies who wanted my chocolate bar. In the end I
        cried, and when she found me, she comforted me, she didn't berate me for
        being weak or for being a boy and crying. I started to hate humans a
        little less because of her.
        <span> I want to be like her; comforting, nice, friendly.</span> But
        I've been told my irl monotonous voice and emotionless face makes me
        appear annoyed or cold. I would frequently catch the bus with her, but
        did not walk her home as it was too far, I would get off at the closest
        stop was still an hour walk. And proceed to get ripped into by my
        step-mother.

        At 12 I had a math teacher who taught algebra at the time. I was nervous
        because didn't understand any of this, but he didn't mind teaching me
        math basics during and after class. He left after my first year, due to
        the school not providing him with learning resources (he had been
        teaching us from his own knowledge, and would create his own cool
        worksheets).
        <span
          >I enjoyed having this teacher, he didn't look down on me for not
          being up to speed with everyone else. I aspire to be an admirable man
          like him.</span

        Throughout my high school years, my English teachers would cuss at me
        when I had not completed work or didn't know how to write, and they
        didn't really teach me. It didn't bother me much but when I turned 16 I
        left school in order to work, because I wasn't learning anything.

        Last year, in August a lady was learning English and asked me to teach
        her, upon returning to NZ, I've been learning English writing, like;
        complete and incomplete sentences, nouns, adjectives, punctuation, etc.
        I've been doing some writing and have been reading some books. I learn
        English for myself and so I can teach her.
        <span
          >If not for her wanting to learn English from me, my writing today
          would probably be unreadable and stuck at a lower level.</span

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </li>
      <p>I don't know what my strengths are for my learning journey.</p>
      <li>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning career development.
        How might these affect your learning journey?

        Bad memory. I take notes because I will forget, and will often need a
        refresher. Tasks usually take longer because I forget how to do things.

      <li>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.

        Guy operating the machine made a mistake and started blaming me and
        calling me a r*tarded f*cking *racial slur*, and I politely asked how I
        can do better next time, he said "there is no use explaining it like a
        r*tard like you." I continued to do the same thing I was already doing,
        as I saw nothing wrong with it. He would often get angry at other people
        too.

          met with an unhelpful response. But I guess he should not expect me to
          do better when he had the chance to explain but refused.</span

        17 year old me, working the till. I'd been there for couple months, a
        lot of young children would come in but a few times they wouldn't have
        enough money, one even came in with different currency and didn't speak
        English. I would put my own money in the till but the boss lady didn't
        like that. I told her that she wasn't losing anything. as some point the
        boss prohibited me from selling pies, and also decided without warning.
        I kept the shop open 7 days a week ~ 14 hours a day, for two weeks. When
        she came back she made a mess and left and when she came back again an
        hour later, she screamed at me asking why there was a mess and why I
        haven't cleaned it up. She was also angry about the fact I hadn't sold
        any pies in two weeks, I told her that she didn't allow me to. She told
        me I was useless and said she could do it herself, I got only $400 for
        my two weeks of work. After a week she was begging me to come back and
        that she needs help, but I never responded.

          is unable to be contacted. And I followed orders but I somehow still
          did something wrong.</span
